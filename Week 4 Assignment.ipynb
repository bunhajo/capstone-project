    "The goal of this study is to give insights to a real state investor from Manhattan. Which areas are the best to invest accroding to your needs? Which is the main characteristics of the real state market in every neighbourhood?\n",

    "### Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you are a real state investor that wants to focus their next steps in the New York area, but first you want to know which areas fit best your appetite. Maybe you are more focused in suburban areas with low price per square meter, or maybe you are into the luxury segment and want to know which places the high end clients prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this study, we'll categorize neighbourhoods into different clusters that will describe which kind of investment fits them better.\n",

    "+ Clean the data, with focus in the 'ADDRESS' and 'SALE PRICE' columns\n",
    "+ Assign latitude and longitude coordinates to each row, so we can apply _Four Square_ API\n",
    "+ Build the dataframe that correlates main characteristics of real state sales to each neighbourhood."
